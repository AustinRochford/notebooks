This is the Vagrant configuration I use to launch virtual machines that I use as [IPython](http://ipython.org/) notebook servers.

To provision a virtual machine, run `vagrant up`.  To run an IPython notebook server, run `make run`.

With the included port forwarding, you can access the notebook server at `localhost:8888`.
